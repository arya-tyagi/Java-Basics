# java-algorithms-with-tests

This repository contains a collection of logic-based programming problems implemented in Java, each with corresponding Unit Tests written using JUnit 5.

It is designed to serve as a practice ground for core programming concepts, clean coding principles, and test-driven development in Java.

## Features

- Logical problem-solving exercises in Java
- Well-structured, clean, and readable implementations
- JUnit 5 test cases included for each program
- Organised project structure suitable for extension or integration into larger projects

## Included Programs

The following types of problems are covered:

- Prime number check

Each program is implemented with simplicity and clarity, and thoroughly tested.

## Running Tests

This project uses Maven to manage dependencies and run tests. To execute all test cases:

```bash
mvn test
